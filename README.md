The Qu Processor is a 32-bit RISC-V CPU designed in SystemVerilog with a superscalar, out-of-order, and speculative execution pipeline.

## Status

All stages are fully implemented and tested for R, I, B & S-type instructions. The pipeline now supports speculative execution.

### Next Steps

- ðŸš§ Other instruction types in the RV32I ISA module
- ðŸš§ ISA extensions Zicsri and Zifencei
- ðŸš§ Full verification and compliance tests
- ðŸš§ Branch prediction
