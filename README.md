The Qu Processor is a 32-bit RISC-V CPU designed in SystemVerilog with a superscalar, out-of-order, and speculative execution pipeline. It is loosely based on Apple's Firestorm/Icestorm microarchitecture from M1 series processors. The Qu Processor is intended as an educational endeavor for a better understanding of modern processor architectures beyond simpler beginner-level undertakings.

## Architecture

The Qu Processor has a seven-stage superscalar out-of-order instruction pipeline. These seven stages are:

##### Fetch (IF)

Fetch stage reads instructions from the program memory, and is basically the receiving end of the pipeline for the instructions. This stage includes program counter and branch prediction logic. **An elaborate branch prediction logic is yet to be implemented. In the current implementation, the processor continues fetching subsequent instructions, which is equivalent to branches being predicted as not taken by default.**

##### Decode (ID)

Decode stage analyzes the incoming instruction, and converts it to a format (micro-op) in a way that makes processing easier in the following stages.

##### Map (MP)

Map stage performs register renaming to handle WAR and WAW hazards. This is the stage where logical registers of the ISA are mapped to the physical registers of the microarchitecture.

##### Rename (RN)

Rename stage allocates a reservation station entry and a reorder buffer entry for the instruction in process. The instruction is then saved to the reservation station to be read from the back-end.

##### Schedule (SC)

Schedule stage reads from the reservation station in batches. It then passes them through based on what type they are or whether they have their source operands ready for use. For faster operation, schedule stage may choose to change the order of the instructions, which is the very thing that makes the microarchitecture "out-of-order".

##### Execute (EX)

Execute stage consists of an arithmetic logic unit and a load-store unit that can be utilized in parallel by two different in-flight instructions. This separation is thought to fast-track load-store instructions, which usually have a longer completion time due to memory access latency.

##### Retire (RT)

Retire stage is where instructions are "committed" in-order, which means that they are finally granted permission to update the state elements existent in the computing system, such as the physical registers and the memory. However, they might also be flushed in case of a mispredicted branch, unconditional jump, or exception.
